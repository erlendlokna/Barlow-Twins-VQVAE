# Barlow Twins integration to VQVAE

Implementation mainly inspired by the TimeVQVAE model.
go to the original TimeVQVAE implementation for details: [a link](https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE)

This repository contains the code for a Variational Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) implementation including STFT. It also contains code for a dual-branched VQVAE encoder to enable the self-supervision through barlow twins. Illustrated below:
